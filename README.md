# Replication Materials for ["A Dynamic Theory of Deterrence and Compliance"](https://github.com/cliffbekar/dynamic_deterrence/blob/main/A%20Dynamic%20Theory%20of%20Deterrence%20and%20Compliance.pdf)

Repository contains both Matlab and Python Code that will allow replication of all results and figures.

* Python code written and maintained by [Cliff Bekar](https://sites.google.com/a/lclark.edu/bekar/home).
* Matlab code written and maintained by [Ken Carlaw](https://epp.ok.ubc.ca/about/contact/kenneth-carlaw/).

Figures 1 - 16 correspond to the order figures appear in the text of the paper.


1. Python Code [Dynamics, Python Codebase.ipynb](https://github.com/cliffbekar/dynamic_deterrence/blob/main/Dynamics%2C%20Python%20Codebase.ipynb)

> Python code implemented in a JupyterLab Notebook (Python3 kernel). Code is organized in order the relevant figure or computation occurs in the text of the paper. Computations are mostly handled separately from visualization. Results of computation are stored locally and then loaded by the relevant visualization. This lets users render figures without having to rerun underlying computation each time. User must therefore specificy, in the first code block, the local file path (set the variable in the first code block at line 23).
